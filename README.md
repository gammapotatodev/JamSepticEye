Exit Wound is a short, atmospheric 3D puzzle adventure set in a world where death isn’t the end, but the beginning of your final trial.

You are dead. Your heart gave out, and now your soul is trapped in Hell, waiting to be judged for eternity.
Yet something keeps you tethered: the defibrillator in your chest. Each pulse jolts your spirit free for a brief moment, letting you roam between body and soul.

Navigate the infernal halls, solve twisted puzzles, and face the echoes of your own sins. To escape damnation, you’ll need to play by Hell’s rules or break them entirely.
